<h3 align="left">A bit about me:</h3>
Hello! I'm Ammar Idham. I'm from Bandar Baru Bangi, Selangor and currently studying in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. My hobby is playing video games, and I took this course to have a career in developing video games. 


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **C++**
- âš¡ Fun fact **I'm not funny**

<h2 align="left">ðŸ”Ž Reflections:</h2>
<h3 align="left">Assignment 1: Visit to NALI 2023</h3>
It was an experience in and of itself. I got to see many wonderful ideas that people came up with. I especially was delighted to got try a virtual reality headset that was used for improving education in architecture. I hope that these innovations helps to create an immersive and effective learning environment.


<h3 align="left">Assignment 2: Industry Talk with Clarity Techwork</h3>
I got to learn a lot about ICT jobs such as Web/API developer, Android developer, UI/UX designer and QA Testing analyst. The people from each of these positions shared how they got to where they are now, the importance of each job and what to do to improve once we have a career. It gave me a lot of insight to the world of the IT industry, and what I can do to ensure I can get a spot as someone working in IT.


<h3 align="left">Assignment 3: Industry Visit to UTM Digital</h3>
As a student of UTM, I use a lot of services provided by UTM Digital. For me to see their operations first hand, it gives me a good outlook and the future of these services. They have quite a good and professional working environment and they take security extremely seriously. When we visited the data room, we weren't allowed to bring our phones. This also gives me a look into how the office of an IT company is like in general. It fills me with hope that one day I can have a position in an IT company.


<h3 align="left">Assignment 4: Industry Talk about System Development</h3>
In this modern age where technology is rapidly advancing, people must keep up to date and adapt with all the changes over time. Unlike other industries, new innovations and applications are developed all the time in the IT industry. Subsequently, as a computer science student, I must also follow and implement all these new innovations and applications instead of still holding on to old techniques. 

<h3 align="left">Activity: Assembling a PC</h3>
I've always seen videos of how to build a PC. Now that I've actually done it, its not too difficult in my opinion. This makes me think that anyone that has the right components and receiving instructions can build their own PC. PCs are also very easy to disassemble, making it easy to replace parts.
